I am a Student and work seeking a man from Lithuania, with a big passion for technology. That might not change the world, but it might help keep the world stable, at least for now. I started my journey in it with making smart solution for my school, manly in 12th. Grade. I am interested in compiled computer languages, mainly C & C++ , Of cures I like modern things like Rust . Weirdly I in to the old stuff from 90s, computer hacking/pranking culture, programming on embedded systems, making BIOS hacking, guitar solos & music. I just like the past. The old, time tested things.

* Iâ€™m working as a Front-end developer and learning fundamentals of software engineering in C++. But because Linux started accepting Rust source code, I am interested in rust too.
* My dream is an ability to make drivers for IRL devices. Like Gpu's, Cpu's or 3D printers.
* Moreover, I'm interested in DevOps. Mainly in Linux and making programs work without any errors.
* In my free time I make music, make games, 3D model and run a small table lamp web shop.
